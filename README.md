Text Editor Diary

Welcome to Text Editor Diary, a clean and intuitive desktop text editor built using Python and Tkinter. This project was designed to combine simplicity with functionality, giving users an efficient tool for writing, coding, or note-taking.

It comes with all the features you’d expect from a modern text editor: create, open, save, and save-as options; undo and redo; find and replace; and a live status bar showing word and character counts.

The title bar updates dynamically to reflect the current file name, while auto-save ensures your work is never lost.

This project showcases practical GUI development, event-driven programming, and thoughtful user-focused design. The code is modular, maintainable, and built with real-world usability in mind. Whether for productivity or learning purposes, Text Editor Diary demonstrates the ability to create polished, functional software from scratch, making it a great addition to any developer portfolio.
